## Analysis and Challenges
In this project shapes, codes, and pivot tabels were used in order to get the best outcome.  
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

This was a fun one to make it helped me organize the date and the money made the time frame of the Campaign. If you read the data you can see that in May thats when the most success was made. 
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

This one was very helpful to make because this helps you get percentages of the success was made and if the goal was reached. If you read the data you can see the most success is made at the 35,000 mark. 
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
It was hard understanding the pivot table but I eventully got it and it helped me organize the funds.
## Results
The Result of this was a very well organized Dashboard that was interactive which allowed the data to be specific and percise. It was hard to get where I am with this project but now ive gained the ability to make more that are similar to the one I currently made. 
- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

They are resourceful. They are organized. They help read and understand the Launch date money flow for people who need help analysing data. 
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

They are resourceful. They are organized. They help read and understand the goal money flow for people who need help analysing data. 
- What are some limitations of this dataset?

It doesnt allow me to put in a map to make it interactive and cool. I wish they had more graphs to give a more detailed explanation of the data. 
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

Here are some good examples to indclude in your dashboard. The first graph helps understand sales by country and which country made the most. In this case it's the US. In the second graph it helps you understand sales by Parent Category. In this case it was the technology category that made the most money.
